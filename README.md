lua for Unikraft
=============================

This is the port of lua for Unikraft as external library. By default,
when running the port will go into interactive mode. Alternatively,
you can run a script from a file if passed as a initrd parameter.

Please refer to the `README.md` as well as the documentation in the `doc/`
subdirectory of the main unikraft repository.
